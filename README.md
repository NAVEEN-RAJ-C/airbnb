# Airbnb Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the code and resources for an Airbnb data analysis project aimed at extracting valuable insights using MongoDB Atlas. The project involves data cleaning, geospatial visualizations, and dynamic plotting to uncover pricing trends, availability patterns, and location-based insights. The primary objectives of this project are outlined below:
## Objectives

    MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval
        Establish a seamless connection to MongoDB Atlas to retrieve the Airbnb dataset efficiently for analysis.

    Data Cleaning and Preparation
        Perform thorough data cleaning, addressing issues such as missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions. This step ensures accurate analysis results.

    Interactive Streamlit Web Application
        Develop an interactive web application using Streamlit, featuring dynamic maps that display the distribution of Airbnb listings.
        Enable users to explore and interact with essential listing factors like prices, ratings, and property types.

    Price Analysis and Visualization
        Conduct an in-depth price analysis using dynamic plots and charts.
        Investigate pricing variations based on location, property type, and seasonal trends.

    Availability Pattern Analysis
        Explore availability patterns across different seasons, presenting occupancy rates and demand fluctuations through suitable visualizations.

    Location-Based Insights
        Extract and visualize data specific to chosen regions or neighborhoods, providing valuable location-based insights.

    Interactive Filtering and Exploration
        Develop interactive visualizations that empower users to filter and delve deeper into the dataset, enhancing their understanding.

    Comprehensive Dashboard Creation
        Build a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI, integrating various visualizations to present key insights derived from the analysis.

## Getting Started
